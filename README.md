# Battle formations

# Brief
Formations add tactical depth to offensive and defensive decision making when players micromanage organised groups in strategy games. This paper investigates the history of tactical formations and their use in video games. It implements a coordinated movement system based on the concepts of virtual leaders and predefined fixed slots. This approach is tested in a Unity 3D game environment using C#. From the results, it concludes that navigating around the environment as a group can be challenging but work around solutions can be applied to specific cases.
